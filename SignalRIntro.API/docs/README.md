# SignalR using ASP.NET Core and .Net 7

This is a simple application on how to use SignalR using ASP.NET Core and .Net 7

## Installation

There's no required prerequisite to get the project running. Just ensure to build the project to automatically install [Microsoft.AspNetCore.SignalR.Client](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.AspNetCore.SignalR.Client/7.0.8/)

## Testing it with Postman

Run the project. Open a postman then click File > New and select WebSocket Request. Instead of using http or https, we will be using wss and with that we will get this as url wss://localhost:7105/chat-hub.

Hit Connect to establish connection.

Add the following to New Message

> {"protocol":"json","version":1}

Click Send and you will received a response like this.

>> {"type":1,"target":"ReceivedMessage","arguments":["ZxbYAsDDnrwgKtyZLJ-tEA has joined."]}

Client may also sent a message to all clients by using the following in the New Message

> {"arguments":["Hello there"],"invocationId": "0", "target":"SendMessage","type":1}

It will respond like this.

>> {"type":1,"target":"ReceivedMessage","arguments":["zM_LYcw6aJhRS4FhROfbTg: Hello there."]}

If you take a look into Program.cs, there's a `broadcast` post method there to send notifications to all clients. You can either test it using Postman or with swagger definition after running the app.

Pull requests are not welcome. The intention of this is to provide a brief example on how to use the package for SignalR development.
